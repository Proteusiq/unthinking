## Skipped (Not Relevant)

The following paper types are filtered out:
- RAG/retrieval papers (unless testing reasoning directly)
- Domain-specific applications (medical, legal, finance, traffic, chemistry)
- Image/audio/video generation and understanding
- Efficiency/quantization papers without reasoning analysis
- Tool-specific papers (code, SQL, visualization)
- Safety/alignment papers not about reasoning
- Survey/taxonomy papers without new findings on reasoning
- Training methods without reasoning insights
