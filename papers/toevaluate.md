## Triage Criteria

Promote to `toread.md` if paper:
- Directly tests reasoning claims with controlled experiments
- Provides new quantitative evidence (not just benchmarks)
- Challenges OR strongly supports the thesis with data
- High-impact venue or award-winning

Discard if paper:
- Tangentially related (mentions reasoning but doesn't test it)
- Overlaps significantly with already-analyzed papers
- Domain-specific application without generalizable insights
- No empirical evidence (opinion/position papers)
- Training/efficiency methods without reasoning analysis
- RAG/retrieval-focused without reasoning insights
- Multi-agent infrastructure without reasoning tests
